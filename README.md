# Taylor Equipment

This was a project that I developed for a client. I used a bootstrap based template and restructured it very heavily to match client's current website with some minor changes.


####Template

I left the template in the files to be able to see the difference between the original template and my final product. The template is labeled as (Orignial Template).html within the Final folder.

####Final Product

My final product can be found within the Final directory (minus the template of course).

#### Contact

Feel free to contact me with any questions!
